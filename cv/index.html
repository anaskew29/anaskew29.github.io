Academic & Research Experience
Undergraduate Student Instrument Project Student Flight Research Opportunity
University of South Alabama Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
Mentors: Edmund Spencer, Ph.D., Samuel Russ, Ph.D., Carlos Montalvo, Ph.D., and Saeed Latif, Ph.D.
Time Dedicated: August 2015 – February 2016: 3+ hours per week
	Responsibilities: 
In August of 2015, I began working on the development of a CubeSat to launch in NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative program. This CubeSat is to be an expansion on the launching of a payload on a sounding rocket completed in 2015. The payload measured the changes in impedance as the rocket changed altitude. The payload on the CubeSat will measure the difference in impedance in different positions above the Earth’s atmosphere. I developed a program to convert the illegible data given by the payload into a usable form so that the data can be interpreted as it is received.

Undergraduate Directed Studies
University of South Alabama Biology Department
Mentor: Glen Borchert, Ph.D.
Time dedicated: October 2013 – May 2014: 3+ hours per week
Responsibilities: 
In October of 2013, I began assisting in the development and testing of a new way of producing miRNA sponges that decreases cost and increases throughput. MiRNA sponges are short miRNA strands that bind to certain miRNA sequences which can affect how cells behave. My duties included running PCR solutions (amplifies the miRNA sequence) on an agar gel to separate different sponge lengths and extracting the desired sponge lengths, cloning the miRNA sponges, testing for concentration of the sponges, writing lab procedures for performing the PCRs, cloning, and concentration testing, and keeping record of the results of each formula used in cloning. 

UCUR Undergraduate Research Fellow (2013)
University of South Alabama Committee on Undergraduate Research
Mentor: Glen Borchert, Ph.D.
Biology Department, University of South Alabama
April 2013 – October 2013: 20+ hours per week
Responsibilities:
In March of 2013, I was invited to participate in the University of South Alabama’s Undergraduate Research program known as UCUR. During my time in this program, I conducted research on sequencing the genome of the American Shiitake mushroom to explore its potential commercial use. My duties were to extract the DNA from the mushroom cells and monitor its sequencing. I then examined the data given by the sequencer and charted the trends of the genome to similar mushroom species within the same genus. After completion of this project, I presented a poster at the annual UCUR poster session and submitted a paper on our findings.

Non-Academic Work Experience
Software Engineering Intern						        February 2016 – Present
Red Lion Controls
3101 International Drive
Mobile, AL 36606	
Responsibilities:
As an intern at Red Lion Controls, I test and troubleshoot problems with devices and software in development. I also develop and maintain automation programs in AutoIt to expedite the testing process for new releases, as well as fix bugs within the testing software in Java.

Electrical Engineering Co-op		  	  			  August 2014 – August 2015
Alabama Power Company: Substation Maintenance
650 Michigan Avenue
Mobile, AL 36605
		Responsibilities:
As a Co-op at Alabama Power in Substation Maintenance, I assisted in upgrading breakers in the Blakely Island Substation and in the addition of a high voltage side to Basset Creek Substation. The breaker upgrade involved altering substation plans to include the new breakers, as well as altering wiring plans to incorporate the changes required by the differences of the new breakers. My part in the addition to Basset Creek involved assisting with integrating the internal control wiring for the new side with the present systems that were already in place.

Alabama Power Company: General Shops
744 County Road 87
Calera, AL 35040	
Responsibilities:
During my time in General Shops, I developed Microsoft Access databases to assist in management of the transformers in the shop. I also assisted with the execution of Alabama Power’s yearly safety conference. I helped set up the venue and assisted in making sure the event ran smoothly.
